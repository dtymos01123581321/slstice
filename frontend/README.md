Question :
After having read the API documentation, is there anything that jumps out as a potential issue ?

- swagger documentation doesn't match swagger.json

After implementation feedback :
Did you encounter any issues during the implementation ? If so, were you able to bypass them?
- I did not face any problems, the usual solutions

Looking closely at the response of the API, do you think there is another way to implement the app ? If yes, what other option could exist ? If no, why not ?
- It would be possible to make a join for tables on the server side, and not make additional requests

If you were in direct contact with the API service team, what could you ask them to do to make your life easier or optimise the performances ?
- Make tables join in order not to make unnecessary queries
- For large amounts of data, use server-side cache for optimization

What was the most difficult part of the implementation for you and why ?
nothing was difficult. There was something new and interesting - a blurred background

On a scale of 1 to 10, are you satisfied with the result ? Is there anything that needs more attention ?
- 8. I think not, because the project is very small

How long did it take you to implement this development ? Was it longer or shorter than what you initially expected ?
- It took about 4 hours, but most of the time dealt with the documentation
